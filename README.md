This repository will eventually hold all of my Computer Science 101 (Introduction to Java) programming projects, including but not necessarily limited to all of the projects, and Labs. Each one of these projects recieved a 100%, and is entirely and uniquely my own work.

Rubrics and descriptions are available for the projects, while there are only descriptions for the labs.

Tester code for labs exists. Be wary, as I did not write it. This accounts for the lack of documentation and the difference in formatting of files. The professor and I disagreed on certain things such as putting curly brackets on a new line or not, among various other conventions.

Finally, I am human, so there may be better ways to do things, or issues that I and my professor missed during grading. I've done my best to correct work that was submitted and had pointed marked off.

Please use responsibily, as Universities/High Schools do check for plagarism.
